User Management API
This project is a complete ASP.NET Core Web API for managing users, developed as part of a technical assignment.

Project Overview
The User Management API provides a robust system for performing CRUD operations on User entities. It features data validation using DataAnnotations, custom logging middleware, and is configured for modern API development.

CRUD Endpoints
The following endpoints are available in the UsersController:

Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/api/users	Retrieves a list of all users.
POST	/api/users	Creates a new user. Expects a JSON body with Name and Email.
PUT	/api/users/{id}	Updates an existing user by their ID.
DELETE	/api/users/{id}	Removes a user from the system by their ID.
Data Validation
The User model uses System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations to ensure data integrity:

Id: Unique integer identifier.
Name: Required field.
Email: Required field and must be a valid email format ([EmailAddress]).
Example of a validation error response:

{
  "type": "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9110#section-15.5.1",
  "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
  "status": 400,
  "errors": {
    "Email": ["Invalid email address"]
  }
}
Middleware
The project includes a custom Logging Middleware (LoggingMiddleware.cs).

Functionality: Logs the HTTP Request Method (e.g., GET, POST) and the Request Path (e.g., /api/users) to the console for every incoming request.
Registration: Registered in Program.cs using app.UseMiddleware<LoggingMiddleware>().
GitHub Copilot Debugging
GitHub Copilot was utilized during development to identify and fix common issues. Examples include:

Missing DataAnnotations: Copilot suggested adding using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations; when I forgot it for the [Required] attribute.
ModelState Validation: Copilot helped generate the check if (!ModelState.IsValid) in the controller to handle validation errors gracefully.
LINQ Queries: When implementing the PUT endpoint, Copilot suggested the correct use of .FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == id) to find the existing user.
Debugging Example: If an error occurs where id is not found, Copilot can suggest adding:

if (user == null) return NotFound();
